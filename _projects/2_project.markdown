With a van der Waals ferromagnet (Fe3GeTe2) sandwiched by two antiferromagnets (oxidized Fe3GeTe2 and CrSe), non-antisymmetric dependence of exchange bias on field cooling was observed. This exchange bias is highly tunable by the cooling fields, showing a maximum value of ~90 mT at 5 K. This work opens up new routes towards designing and controlling 2D spintronic devices.
