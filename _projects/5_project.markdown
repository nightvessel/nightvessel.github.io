The degradation of properties under atmospheric conditions and high-density charge traps in black phosphorus have largely limited its actual mobility thus hindering its future applications. Here, we report the fabrication of stable sandwiched heterostructures by encapsulating atomically thin black phosphorus between hexagonal boron nitride layers to realize ultra-clean interfaces that allow a high field-effect mobility of ∼1,350 cm<sup>2</sup>V<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> at room temperature and on–off ratios exceeding 10<sup>5</sup>. At low temperatures, the mobility even reaches ∼2,700 cm<sup>2</sup>V<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> and quantum oscillations in black phosphorus two-dimensional hole gas are observed at low magnetic fields. Importantly, the sandwiched heterostructures ensure that the quality of black phosphorus remains high under ambient conditions.
