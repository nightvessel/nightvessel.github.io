Spin splitting in graphene is required to develop graphene-based multifunctional spintronic devices with low dissipation and long-distance spin transport. Magnetic proximity effect is known to achieve spin transport in graphene by generating a spin splitting in the band structure. 

Antiferromagnets (AFMs) are magnetically ordered but with no net magnetization. This helps eliminate fringing fields and allows information stored in an AFM device to remain insensitive to external magnetic perturbations. In this project, we have observed the quantum oscllations in monolayer graphene interfaced with an AFM thin film of chromium selenide (CrSe). Upon the field cooling, changes in the interfacial antiferromagnetic order can significantly modify the spin splitting in graphene by shifting the spectrum of the SdH oscillations according to the cooling field strength and direction. The magnetism in graphene is also supported by the magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements. This induced exchange splitting energy is estimated to be 134 meV under zero field cooling from the fitting using machine learning.

    Both the quantum oscillations and quantum Hall plateau in graphene can be shifted through the field cooling. As a comparison, transport properties in CrSe thin films show little dependence on the field cooling.

We have explained this field-dependent transport properties of graphene from the spin splitting in this material which originates from the graphene/CrSe interface.
