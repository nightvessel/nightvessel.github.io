A strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI) can be induced in metallic thin films by proximity to monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>), a semiconductor with intrinsic strong Ising SOI. The upper critical field of the thin-film superconductor is enhanced by the induced SOI, even though the zero-field critical temperature is unchanged or reduced.
