**Course: Solid State Physics**<br/>
Instructor: Prof. Kang L. Wang <br/>
Teaching Assistant, Winter quarter, 2018 @ University of California, Los Angeles

This lecture includes 
* the fundamentals of carrier transport in semiconductors and devices from Macro to Meso and to Nano scales and quantum value and limit; 
* foundations so that one can tackle new problems in research and in working places;
* current research directions: advanced CMOS and beyond, spintronics and magnetism.

I have
* assisted lecturer with the slides preparation and discussed the fundamentals of physics;
* prepared and graded homework;
* prepared and graded midterm and final exam;
* implemented office hour for graduate students to explain the physics details in the lecture or the slides. This includes one-on-one instruction, group teaching and homework help.

**Course: Laboratory for General Physics I & II**<br/>
Teaching Assistant, Spring 2015 & Fall 2015 & Spring 2016 @ The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology

This lecture includes
* experiments in mechanics and heat are chosen to illustrate the experimental foundations of physics presented in the lecture courses;
* experiments in static and current electricity and magnetism, and optics are chosen to illustrate the experimental foundations of physics in the lecture courses.

I have: 
* explained the physics details in a lecture ranging from a half hour to one hour for every experiment;
* helped and guided the students with the principles and technical setups when they carried out the experiment;
* read and graded the reports after class;
* arranged office hour for the undergraduate students to ask questions and understand more about the physics. 

**Course: Astronomy for Beginners**<br/>
Teaching Assistant, Summer 2015 @ The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology

This lecture includes
* introduction to our Universe, observation in astronomy, origin of modern astronomy;
* Newton's law of motions, gravity, light, atoms and telescope;
* the Sun, stellar formation and evolution, white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes;
* the Milky way Galaxy, Normal galaxies, active galaxies and supermassive black holes;
* foundation of modern cosmology, dark matter, dark energy and the fate of the Universe.

I have: 
* read and graded the homework after class;
* arranged office hour for the undergraduate students to ask questions and understand more.
