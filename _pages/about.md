My name is 吴鹦鹰 in chinese. I major in Physics for both my undergraduate and Master's degree. In March 2010, I was admmited into the Kuang Yaming Honors School, Nanjing University, China, without the national higher education entrance examination. After getting the Bachelor's degree in Science, I went to the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in September, 2014 for my Master of Philosophy degree in Science with a scholarship. During these two years (2014-2016), my advisor was Dr. Ning Wang and my reasearch focused on the electronic properties of few-layer black phosphorus, a new emerging material. We have obtained a record high mobility, quantum oscillations, negative compressibility and the quantum capacitance in few-layer black phosphorus based devices. At the same time, I also started to work on proximity effect between layered materials. We have successfully induced Ising spin-orbit interaction in aluminum thin films on monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. After that, I went to University of California, Los Angeles in 2016 for my PhD degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering under the guidance of Dr. Kang L. Wang. My projects is mainly about the magnetic van der Waals materials. The first project is about the induced magnetism in graphene when coupled to an antiferromagnet through the transport measurements and magneto-optic Kerr effect. My second project is the observation of Néel-type skyrmions in Fe<sub>3</sub>GeTe<sub>2</sub> when coupled to the tungsten ditelluride up to 195 K. Currently, I am working on the emergent topological layered materials, like Mn<sub>1</sub>Bi<sub>4</sub>Te<sub>7</sub>.
