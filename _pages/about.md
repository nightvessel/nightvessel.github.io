Her name is 吴鹦鹰 in Chinese. She majors in Physics for both undergraduate and Master's degree. In March 2010, she was admitted into the Kuang Yaming Honors School, Nanjing University, China, without the national higher education entrance examination. After getting the Bachelor's degree in Science, she went to the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in September, 2014 for her Master of Philosophy degree in Science with a scholarship. During these two years (2014-2016), her advisor was Dr. Ning Wang and her research focused on the electronic properties of few-layer black phosphorus, a new emerging material. She has obtained a record high mobility, quantum oscillations, negative compressibility and the quantum capacitance in few-layer black phosphorus based devices. At the same time, she also started to work on proximity effect between layered materials. She has successfully induced Ising spin-orbit interaction in aluminum thin films on monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. After that, she went to University of California, Los Angeles in 2016 for her PhD degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering under the guidance of Dr. Kang L. Wang. Her research is mainly on the magnetic van der Waals materials. The first project is about the induced magnetism in graphene when coupled to an antiferromagnet through the transport measurements and magneto-optic Kerr effect. Her second project is the observation of N\'eel-type skyrmions in Fe<sub>3</sub>GeTe<sub>2</sub> when coupled to the tungsten ditelluride up to 195 K. Currently, She is working on the emergent topological layered materials, like Mn<sub>1</sub>Bi<sub>4</sub>Te<sub>7</sub>.
